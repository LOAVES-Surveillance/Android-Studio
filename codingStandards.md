Android studio has a built in code reformatting utility.  On Windows/Linux, the command to run the code reformatter is  Ctrl + Alt + L. Ubuntu requires the Shift key to be pressed as well.  On Mac, the command to run the code reformatter is Option + Command + L.  This should be run in order for the code to look clean and consistent.

Variable and function names should be in lower camel case.  Ex: lowerCamelCase
Class and interface names should be in upper camel case.  Ex: UpperCamelCase
finals should be in macro case.  Ex: MACRO\_CASE

Allowed magic numbers are -1, 0, and 1. Other values can be utilized via a final (constant).

Code changes should only be pushed to the master branch when it is in the form of a pull request that has been reviewed by another team member.
